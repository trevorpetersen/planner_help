Instructions:

  First make sure that you have the required dependencies. Use requirements.txt
  to install these libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup. Use the following
  command:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


  One you have all the required libraries installed follow these steps:

  1. Scrape departments
  2. Scape classes using previously scraped departments
  3. Scrape WebReg using previously scraped classes

    1. Use scrapeDepartments to scrape departments. This program will output a
    text file of all the department codes and names at UCSD. Specify the output
    file as the first parameter.

    Usage: python scrapeDepartments.py [outputFile]
    Ex:  python scrapeDepartments.py departments.txt

    2. You can scrape either a list of all classes (includes classes that are
    not offered this quarter) or just classes offered this quarter. To to do
    either, you will need a tab delimited list of all the departments that
    you wish to get classes from (This is obtained in step 1). The output is a
    tab delimited list of classes for all the given departments.

    All classes:
      Usage: python scrapeAllClasses.py [departmentFileName] [outputFileName]
      Ex: scrapeAllClasses.py departments.txt classes.txt

    Current classes:
      Usage: python scrapeCoursesFromWebReg.py [departmentFileName] [outputFileName] [QuarterCode] [WebRegCookie]
      Ex: python scrapeCoursesFromWebReg.py departments.txt classes.txt WI18 [Your cookie]

      Note: Quarter codes are the quarter (FA, WI, SP) followed by year.
        Ex: FA16 or SP19
          
        SU = Summer Med School
        S1 = Summer Session I
        S2 = Summer Session II
        S3 = Special Summer Session
        FA = Fall Quarter
        WI = Winter Quarter
        SP = Spring Quarter
