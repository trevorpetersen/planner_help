Setup:

  First make sure that you have the required dependencies. Use requirements.txt
  to install these libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup. Use the following
  command:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

  * Note: Some of the scripts require a valid WebReg cookie to use. If you wish
  to use one of these functions, open cred.py and add a username/password or
  add a cookie by copying and pasting the output of cookieHelper.py

Examples:

  Save the list of all departments at UCSD to a file named "departs.txt"
    python scrapeDepartments.py departs.txt

  Save a list of all courses using departs.txt to a file named "courses.txt"
    python scrapeAllCourses.py departs.txt courses.txt

  Scrape the list of classes from Winter 2018 from WebReg (you must have already
  added credentials to cred.py) to a file named "currentCourses.txt"
    python scrape.py currentCourses.txt WI18


Uses:

  This library provides the following scrips:

    * scrapeDepartments.py - save a list of all departments at UCSD to a tab
      delimited file
    * scrapeAllCourses.py - save a list of all courses offered at UCSD to a tab
      delimited file
    * scrapeCapes.py - save a list of capes to a tab delimited file
    * cookieHelper.py - gets a cookie using a username and password


    *** The following require you to provide credentials ***

    * scrape.py - gets an up to date list of departments and then saves all the
      current courses from WebReg
    * scrapeCoursesFromWebReg.py - save a list of current courses at UCSD to a
      tab delimited file
    * getAvailableQuarters.py - prints a list of terms currently available for
      scraping (such as WI18 or FA17)
