Setup:

  First make sure that you have the required dependencies. Use requirements.txt
  to install these libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup. Use the following
  command:

  Linux:
  pip install -r requirements.txt


Setting up cred.py (optional):

  Some of the scripts require a valid WebReg cookie to use. If you wish
  to use one of these functions, open cred.py and add a username/password or
  add a cookie by copying and pasting the output of cookieHelper.py

Examples:

  Save the list of all departments at UCSD to a file named "departs.txt"
    python departments.py departs.txt

  Save a list of all courses using departs.txt to a file named "courses.txt"
    python allCourses.py departs.txt courses.txt

  Scrape the list of departments, courses and course data from Winter 2018 from
  WebReg (you must have already added credentials to cred.py) to a files named
  "departs.txt","currentCourses.txt","currentData.txt" respectively
    python scrapeAll.py departs.txt currentCourses.txt currentData.txt WI18
