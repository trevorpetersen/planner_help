Setup:

  First make sure that you have the required dependencies. Use requirements.txt
  to install these libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup. Use the following
  command:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


Setting up cred.py (optional):

  Some of the scripts require a valid WebReg cookie to use. If you wish
  to use one of these functions, open cred.py and add a username/password or
  add a cookie by copying and pasting the output of cookieHelper.py

Examples:

  Save the list of all departments at UCSD to a file named "departs.txt"
    python scrapeDepartments.py departs.txt

  Save a list of all courses using departs.txt to a file named "courses.txt"
    python scrapeAllCourses.py departs.txt courses.txt

  Scrape the list of classes from Winter 2018 from WebReg (you must have already
  added credentials to cred.py) to a file named "currentCourses.txt"
    python scrape.py currentCourses.txt WI18

  Scape course data from webreg for a list of courses (you must have already
  added credentials to cred.py) and save it to a file named "courseData.txt"
    python scrapeWebReg.py currentCourses.txt courseData.txt
